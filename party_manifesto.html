        <div class="section2">The Socialist Unity Party is a mass organization of the working class.</div>
        <div class="section2">Capitalism has cast billions of people around the world into poverty. It afflicts humanity
            with endless wars. It institutionalizes racism and women’s oppression, denies youth the hope of a future,
            and fuels discrimination against gay, lesbian and transgender people, religious minorities, immigrants and
            people with disabilities. Capitalism pits worker against worker in a global race to the bottom. Corporate
            interests wage a never-ending campaign to roll back people’s hard-won democratic rights. Capitalism’s
            insatiable drive for profits has poisoned the Earth’s land, sea, and air. Capitalism treats people and
            nature as disposable commodities in order to transfer the wealth of the planet to a handful of
            multi-billionaires.</div>
        <div class="section2">In solidarity with working people around the world, we stand in opposition to
            imperialism – the system by which corporations use their economic power, along with the political and
            military power of governments, to exploit workers, pillage the environment and corrupt governments around
            the world just as they do here at home.</div>
        <div class="section2">Our organizational practices are based on democracy, equality, unity of action and
            transparency. We do not set ourselves apart from the rest of the working class movement and organizations;
            we have no private agenda, no special interests. We welcome all who share our goals to join us or work
            together in alliance.</div>
